Help Desk Ticketing System (Self Created Project in Python)

This project was created for a course assignment where the scenario was to create a help desk ticketing system prototype for internal staff to submit IT help request tickets to the IT help desk. 

The requirements for the prototype was that it must have the ability to:

- Create a new ticket.
- Respond & resolve an open ticket.
- Reopen a closed ticket.
- Display ticket statistics and information, with statistics changing to reflect current ticket status. 
- Automatically create a new password when "Password Change" is inputted into a ticket.

Generally, creating this prototype proved to be a good beginner project, fun, but also challenging, especially considering that this is my first project created utilising Python. 
In terms of coding this project, it was relatively straight forward with creating each individual feature, with the options menu and ticket creation input coding simple to implement. 
The main challenge I had with coding initially was when ticket information and statistics were displayed, they didn't change to reflect the current status of the tickets or change 
when tickets were modified. But with assistance and some modification to both the Main and Ticket classes, the statistics and information display correctly when updated.

Asteroids Game (Project code created by & acknowledgement to user boularbarsmail)

This project was chosen based on an previous asssignment for another tertiary institute, where we had to create the same game but utilising Snap! to create it. While there were plenty of examples to reference, the decision was made to choose this user's project due to their extensive code
