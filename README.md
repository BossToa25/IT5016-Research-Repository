This project was created for a course assignment where the scenario was to create a help desk ticketing system prototype 
for internal staff to submit IT help request tickets to the IT help desk. 
The requirements for the prototype was that it must have the ability to:

- Create a new ticket.
- Resolve and close a ticket.
- Reopen a closed ticket.
- Display ticket statistics and information, with statistics changing to reflect current ticket status. 
- Automatically create a new password when "Password Change" is inputted into a ticket.
